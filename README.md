With the growing reliance on cloud
computing services for data storage and
processing, ensuring the privacy and security
of sensitive information has become a critical
concern. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) is an emerging cryptographic technique
that enables computations on encrypted data
without needing to decrypt it first, preserving
data confidentiality throughout the process.
This capability makes HE an attractive
solution for cloud computing environments
where sensitive data must remain secure even
when processed by third-party cloud
providers. This review examines the various
types of HE, its use in cloud computing,
challenges faced in its implementation,
recent advancements, and potential future
prospects.
