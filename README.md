With the growing reliance on cloud
computing services for data storage and
processing, ensuring the privacy and security
of sensitive information has become a critical
concern. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) is an emerging cryptographic technique
that enables computations on encrypted data
without needing to decrypt it first, preserving
data confidentiality throughout the process.
This capability makes HE an attractive
solution for cloud computing environments
where sensitive data must remain secure even
when processed by third-party cloud
providers. This review examines the various
types of HE, its use in cloud computing,
challenges faced in its implementation,
recent advancements, and potential future
prospects.
Abstract- Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
offers a transformative approach to cloud
computing by enabling operations on
encrypted data without requiring
decryption. This review highlights the
various types of HE, including Partially
Homomorphic Encryption (PHE),
Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption
(SHE), and Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE). It explores the
potential of HE in ensuring data privacy
and confidentiality during computations
in cloud environments. The review also
addresses the challenges posed by HE,
such as performance issues, key
management, and scalability, while
discussing recent advancements in HE
technologies. Furthermore, applications in
secure data storage, confidential machine
learning, and sectors like healthcare and
finance are examined. Finally, the paper
reflects on the future of HE in cloud
computing and its potential for large-scale
adoption.
